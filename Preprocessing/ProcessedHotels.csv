Governor Havelock transferred the title to the land (on which the bungalows are built), by a hand-written deed to the Havelock Building Company on the payment of Rs. 1307/- and a Peppercorn. The present owners purchased the properties in the mid 1980's and lived there. The Havelock Place Bungalow was first opened to guests in December 1999. In the city, yet miles away... If you've ever visited the Bungalow, you would have noticed how discreet we have been about our presence. To the casual passer-by, the Bungalow appears to be nothing more than an old colonial home. Only a plaque with the name 'Havelock Place Bungalow' engraved on it, indicates that we are open to guests. No wonder the Bungalow continues to be Colombo's best kept secret! We are conveniently located so if you are in the mood for a visit to the Museum, Independence Square, or Temples, or would like to go on a shopping spree, you can get to your destination in a matter of minutes. It's a jungle. But definitely not the concrete type... When you enter our gates and walk along the paved pathways, you realize you are in an oasis, away from the bustle of the city. Trees are an intrinsic part of the Havelock Place Bungalow experience. You can enjoy your breakfast while watching our garden come alive with a variety of birds and butterflies, or relax on a bench and gaze at the stars as night approaches.

The farm is approximately 30 minutes drive from Ella, perched in a small valley above the Ravana-Ella Waterfalls, with views of Ella Rock and Lipton Seat. We produce a range of artisanal teas, coffees, spices and preserves, and we work with the local community to support a variety of educational, economic and environmental initiatives. The old estate farmhouse, the original estate line-rooms (tea-workers’ quarters) and 2 neighbouring bungalows are now operated as a full-service guest-house, offering guests the opportunity to learn more about organic farming and artisanal tea-making, and enjoy our little corner of paradise. Built 100 years ago by one of the first local families to develop their own tea estate, the bungalow has 4 double guest bedrooms, as well as a small study, where we can set up 2 extra single beds. There are two shared bathrooms. The line-rooms have 3 double or twin rooms, each with ensuite bathrooms. Clove Tree House, a 1930s planter’s bungalow about 200 metres from the Amba farmhouse, has 1 family suite, 1 double room and 1 twin room, all with ensuite bathrooms. Clove Tree Cottage, a newer annex to Clove Tree House, has 1 family suite and 1 triple room, both with ensuite bathrooms. All the houses have their own kitchens, living and dining areas, and spectacular views across the valley. For larger groups looking for the ideal place for a group retreat, we can also make arrangements with a couple of nearby guesthouses - offering up to 25 rooms in total. Meals are eaten together, and food is mainly vegetarian, using as much of our own organic produce as possible (including of course our famous Amba tea and coffee!). We serve breakfast, lunch and dinner every day, and can also prepare picnics for excursions. Guests can also enjoy snacks throughout the day at the newly-opened Amba café. We are not licenced, but guests are welcome to bring their own beer, wine and spirits. We recommend staying at least 2 nights so that you have time to enjoy the excellent hikes and stunning sunsets and sunrises in the valley. There are a variety of hiking trails in and around the valley, including gentle walks around the estate and more strenuous climbs - up Ella Rock or St Catherine's Mount, or down to the secret pools atop the waterfall or through our own mini forest reserve. The valley is home to a wide variety of birdlife and wildlife, including deer, wild boar, mongoose, porcupine, peacocks, kingfishers and much more. We also have several bikes, binoculars, badminton, boules, and a big selection of books and board-games that guests are free to use. If you want to explore, there are number of lovely spots just a short drive away: spectacular views at Lipton Seat and Pilkington Point, the monolithic Buddha statues at Buduruwagala, and the wild elephant pools at the top of Diyaluma Falls. Arugam Bay, Yala and Udawalawe National Parks, Nuwara Eliya and Horton Plains are all within 2-3 hours drive. Please note: we also offer public tours of our organic farm and our artisanal tea and coffee production every day at 11am. The tour itself is free, and you can also do an optional tasting after the tour for Rs.600 per person.",info@ambaestate.com,+94 77 999 1353,hotel,0.0,6.832863,81.05892,$,"LKR 8,736 - LKR 29,121",49,Amba Estate Farmstay,2,#2 of 49 B&Bs in Ella,5.0,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g616035-d4041151-Reviews-Amba_Estate_Farmstay-Ella_Uva_Province.html,https://www.facebook.com/ambaestate/
